How did I end up here? Today marks the beginning of a new chapter for me as the Product Design & Strategy Lead at a fintech startup. It’s an exciting shift, and with it, I’ve decided to move my writing to my personal website.

I’ve worked in Product, UX, and Digital Design for years. Writing has always been something I’ve done sporadically, but never consistently. However, if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that writing helps sharpen ideas. So, I’m making it a priority here.

### Why Write?

Writing helps me clarify my thoughts and document what I’m learning along the way. The process of distilling complex ideas into something clear and actionable is invaluable. It forces me to reflect, refine, and ultimately become a better designer and leader.

I’ll be covering topics around:

*   Product and UX design
    
*   Strategy and decision-making
    
*   Lessons learned from working in startups
    

### What’s Next?

Moving forward, my focus is on making this a useful and engaging space. I want to share experiences, lessons, and frameworks that have shaped my work and thinking.

If you’ve followed my work before, welcome back. If you’re new here, I hope you find something valuable. Let’s build something great together.

Stay tuned for more.
