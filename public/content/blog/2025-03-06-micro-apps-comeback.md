**Micro-apps are making a comebackâ€”just not how Apple imagined.**

ðŸš€ **Remember Apple's App Clips?**

The idea was genius: **stream tiny app experiences instead of downloading full apps**â€”perfect for quick, one-time tasks. But they never really took off.

Now, I think **micro-apps are quietly making a comebackâ€”but in a different form.**

Here's why.

Balancing **family, work, and triathlon training** is a logistical puzzle. Every **Friday**, I plan my week, and swimming is always the hardest to fit in. I rotate between **three pools** in Gothenburg, each with different opening hours.

That means **manually checking three separate websites every week.** **Inefficient.**

So I turned to AI.

ðŸ”¹ **Step 1: Scraping the Data**

Using **Firecrawl**, an AI-powered web scraper, I pulled the latest pool schedules with a simple prompt.

ðŸ”¹ **Step 2: Automating It**

With **Lovable**, I built a lightweight tool that:

âœ… Scrapes opening hours from a URL

âœ… Generates a **calendar subscription link (.ics)**

âœ… **Auto-updates my calendarâ€”no manual checks needed**

After ~25 AI-assisted iterations, I had a **fully automated** solution.

ðŸ’¡ **This is the App Clips conceptâ€”without Apple.**

Instead of downloading full apps, I built a micro-app that **solves one problem, seamlessly integrating into my workflow.**

Are **micro-apps** like this the future?
