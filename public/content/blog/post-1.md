Trust is a fundamental part of every career journey. Looking back, I can say with certainty that the relationships I’ve built over the years have played a huge role in where I am today.

More than a decade ago, I started my career in UX and Digital Design as a consultant. It wasn’t the most obvious path, but I had a plan: I wanted to understand business at a deeper level. While a traditional design agency might have offered faster career growth in design alone, joining a consultancy with a management focus helped me develop a broader perspective. I got to see firsthand how business decisions impact product development and design.

Through that experience, I learned that success in product and design isn’t just about skill—it’s about trust. Trust with colleagues, trust with stakeholders, and trust with users. People remember the ones who follow through, who listen, and who can articulate ideas clearly.

Over time, these relationships opened doors to new opportunities, partnerships, and roles that I wouldn’t have found otherwise. Trust isn’t built overnight, but it compounds over time, shaping not just your career but how you approach work itself.

Now, as I take this next step in my journey, I want to continue fostering that same trust—with the people I work with and the community that follows my work.
